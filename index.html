<p>Hello and welcome to your one-stop shop to all things Marine! I'm O.H (pronounced as if you were sighing), and I'll be your guide through the incredibly vast and massively interesting world of Marine Biology!</p>
<p>In this website you'll see how the marine world affects you (yes, you- specifically the person reading this sentence), the importance of understanding the sea, my personal collection of cool websites and links, and, my proudest creation, the taxonomy tree!</p>
<p>So what are you waiting for? Put on your (metaphorical) wetsuit and snorkel, and lets get to exploring this ocean of a website!</p>

<p>Ray-Finned Fishes (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinopterygii">:Actinopterygii</a>) are dumbass, stupid and, altogether, not very smart. </p>
