  <p><center>Hello and welcome to your one-stop shop to all things Marine! I'm O.H (creative name, I know), and I'll be your guide through the incredibly vast and massively interesting world of Marine Biology! In this website you'll see how the marine world affects you (yes, you- specifically the person reading this sentence), the importance of understanding the sea, my personal collection of cool websites and links, and, my proudest creation, the <a href="#WhatIsTheTaxonomyTree?">:taxonomy tree!</a><br>
  So what are you waiting for? Put on your (metaphorical) wetsuit and snorkel, and lets get to exploring this ocean of a website!</center></p>

  <h2>What is the Taxonomy Tree (TM)?</h2>
  <p>The Taxonomy Tree is a (self-proclaimed) masterpiece of coding and another excellent idea from the author (thanks me). The tree follows basic :taxonomic ranking, with its main function being quick and easy identification of a given species.</p>

  <p>Ray-Finned Fishes (also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actinopterygii">:Actinopterygii</a>) are dumbass, stupid and, altogether, not very smart. </p>
